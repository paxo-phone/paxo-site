  title: A free, modular and educational cellphone.
  block1:
    title: Open
    p1: |
      The Paxo project adheres to the principles of open source, both in terms of hardware and software. That
      means that it gives everyone the freedom to use, study, adapt and redistribute the plans and the
      telephone source code (in a non-commercial context).
    p2: |
      This free dimension of the project gives a central place to the community, which mainly helps to
      develop the project.
  block2:
    title: Modular
    p: |
      The free dimension of the project also favors modularity. Anyone can - by modifying the software and
      equipment made available - adapt the operation of the telephone to your needs, whatever they may be.
      The phone then allows everyone to design a wide variety of objects on a solid and stable base.
  block3:
    title: Educational
    p1: |
      The free and modular dimension of the project makes it an ideal educational object. The plans and code made
      available allow everyone to study the operation of a modern smartphone and the modularity allows
      them to practice electronics and computing on a concrete case and in a wide variety of situations. The project
      also covers other fundamental aspects in the design of such an object, whether it is the design, the
      3D modeling or printing.
    p2: |
      The free dimension of the project also aims to raise awareness of the issues surrounding freedom in the digital world.
      In the same way, the modular dimension wishes to raise awareness of the problem of the repairability of electronic devices.
  block4:
    title: History
    p: |
      Three years ago I started the Paxo project in order to create useful devices, which can be made by everyone (DIY - "Do It Yourself")
      on an open-source model (Free of Rights), by optimizing the components of way to preserve the planet as much as possible! At 15 I made
      my first working phone (I am now 16). The electronic circuits, software code and 3D printing models I designed are all available through
      this site. With this approach I hope that everyone will want to create and share their own inventions!

    title: About us
    p: Three years ago, Gabriel started the Paxo project to create useful devices that everyone can make themselves (DIY - "Do It Yourself") using an open-source model, optimizing the components to preserve the planet as much as possible.
      At 15 years old, he built his first functional phone. All the electronic circuits, code, 3D printing software, and modalities that have been designed are available through this site. With this approach, the Paxo Team hopes everyone will be inspired to direct and partner in his inventions!
  block2:
    title: Today
    p: Today, thanks to the media coverage of the project, a community is actively involved. Paxo is divided into several teams
      to distribute the work of hardware, software, design and communication.
